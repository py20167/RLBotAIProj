    <h1>AI project</h1>
    <p>Hey guys! I created this project to show you what AI can really do.</p>
    <p>I tried to make something which most people would understand. I thought about it and I decided to show it you in a video game since a lot of people play video games and it's easiest to show you.</p>
    <p>As you can see there is a video down below(If you dont see it you will see "Your browser does not support the video tag." ooooor you have already clicked on it) and the main gist of it was I coded video game bots and played against them. I even made a montage(@8:51) that shows all the things the bots can do. Watch it its pretty cool</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <video width="580" height="500" controls>
  <source src="schoolProj.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<p>So did you enjoy it?(Put it in the chat if you thought it was cool or what I could do to make it better)</p>
<p>Now I know you might have some questions so you can ask me about them(If it is about the meme you would only get it if you played rocket league for sometime(or know what air dribbling is))</p>
<p>And hey if you want me to make one in class or play against the bots in class I will gladly do it(I'm gonna get beaten but oh well)</p>
<p>If this made absolute no sense to you because you have never played video games before or just totally do not understand I got you</p>
<h1>The explenation(Skip if you understand)</h1>
<p>So where do I start</p>
<p>ok so what I have done here is used a programming language such as python, java, kotlin, rust, or c(you get the point) to make these bots. Now I chose this game exactly because it is like playing real life soccar. The bots know whether to defend or attacks, block for your teamates or not, and so on. Since they are the ones making the decisions you call this Articial Intelligance or AI</p>
<h1>Definetion of AI</h1>
<P>Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</P>
